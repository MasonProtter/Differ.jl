# A stack specialised for reverse-mode AD control flow: the block stack (which basic blocks were
# visited on the forwards pass, replayed in reverse on the pullback pass) and the per-block "comms"
# stacks (forward-computed values the pullback needs back, one push per execution of that block).
# Ported verbatim from Mooncake.jl's `src/stack.jl` — this layer is generic and AD-framework-agnostic.
